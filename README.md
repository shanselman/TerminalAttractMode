# TerminalAttractMode
Given a Profile and folder name, rotates the background of a Terminal with animated gifs

This is the greatest PowerShell script ever written, today.

Run it in another tab using the new open source [Windows Terminal](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/YouCanNowDownloadTheNewOpenSourceWindowsTerminal.aspx) and call

```
./AttractMode.ps -name "profile name" -path "c:\temp\trouble"
```

where name is a Name (has to be unique) of one of your Terminal profiles in profiles.json and Path is a path to a folder with a bunch of animated gifs
